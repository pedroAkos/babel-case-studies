# babel-case-studies

This repository contains the case studies used for the [Babel](https://github.com/pfouto/babel-core) paper accepted in [SRDS'22](https://srds-conference.org).

You can find an eprint of the paper [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.02106.pdf).

We used two different case-studies, that include popular distributed systems applications.
The first case-study is a simple P2P application that uses the HyParView overlay protocol and a simple Flood dissemination protocol.
The second case-study is a State machine replication application, and has different Paxos implementations.
